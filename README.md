# Beginner Scrum Breakdown
### By Zach Walters

## Part One: What is Scrum?

### Scrum is an Agile system used to facilitate the completion of software engineering projects on time and under budget. It is a more flexible system developed for software engineering that evolved from more traditional project management practices out of necessity.
### It is used widely in software development today and an important system to get familiar with if considering a career in the field of information technology.
### Scrum's methodology, or Agile, has four principles that are the heart and soul of the system:
1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4. Responding to change over following a plan
