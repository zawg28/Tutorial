# Beginner Scrum Breakdown
By Zach Walters

Purpose:
The purpose of this tutorial is to give people with little to no exposure to Scrum an overview of what the system entails. The content is a brief introduction to Agile principles and the Scrum system.

Audience:
The target audience of this tutorial are people who are interested in software development who are unfamiliar with Scrum. This would usually be people at the beginning of their careers. Beginner knowledge is an assumption of this tutorial.

## Part One: What is Scrum?

Scrum is an Agile system used to facilitate the completion of software engineering projects on time and under budget. It is a more flexible system developed for software engineering that evolved from more traditional project management practices out of necessity. The point of the system is to deliver functional updates to the software on a regular basis.

It is used widely in software development today and an important system to get familiar with if considering a career in the field of information technology.

Scrum's methodology, or Agile, has four principles that are the heart and soul of the system:
1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4. Responding to change over following a plan

## Part Two: The System

Scrum's system involves intervals of two weeks called **sprints**. At the beginning of each sprint, the development team and product owner get together to determine what needs to get done in this present sprint.

Each task chosen for a specific sprint is put into the **sprint backlog**. This is the pool of tasks that the developers will pull from as they work on the product over the sprint. These tasks are pulled from the **product backlog** which is the pool of tasks that need to be finished in order for the product to be finished.

Each task is given defined completion criteria so everyone can agree upon when the task is finished. This is decided in the meeting along with the sprint backlog. The completion of the sprint is tracked using a **burndown chart** which is posted for everyone to see. The project is transparent from the very beginning to the end.
