# Beginner Scrum Breakdown
By Zach Walters

Purpose:
The purpose of this tutorial is to give people with little to no exposure to Scrum an overview of what the system entails. The content is a brief introduction to Agile principles and the Scrum system.

Audience:
The target audience of this tutorial are people who are interested in software development who are unfamiliar with Scrum. This would usually be people at the beginning of their careers. Beginner knowledge is an assumption of this tutorial.

## Part One: What is Scrum?

Scrum is an Agile system used to facilitate the completion of software engineering projects on time and under budget. It is a more flexible system developed for software engineering that evolved from more traditional project management practices out of necessity. The point of the system is to deliver functional updates to the software on a regular basis.

It is used widely in software development today and an important system to get familiar with if considering a career in the field of information technology.

Scrum's methodology, or Agile, has four principles that are the heart and soul of the system:
1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4. Responding to change over following a plan

## Part Two: The System

Scrum's system involves intervals of two weeks called **sprints**. At the beginning of each sprint, the development team and Product Owner get together to determine what needs to get done in this present sprint.

Each task chosen for a specific sprint is put into the **sprint backlog**. This is the pool of tasks that the developers will pull from as they work on the product over the sprint. These tasks are pulled from the **product backlog** which is the pool of tasks that need to be finished in order for the product to be finished.

Each task is given defined completion criteria so everyone can agree upon when the task is finished. This is decided in the meeting along with the sprint backlog. The completion of the sprint is tracked using a **burndown chart** which is posted for everyone to see. The project is transparent from the very beginning to the end.

Every single day, Scrum teams get together for a time-locked 15-minute stand up meeting. Three questions are commonly asked of each team member:
1. What did you get done yesterday?
2. What do you plan on getting done today?
3. Are there any obstacles?

After each sprint, a **sprint retrospective** takes place to reflect on what went well and what went poorly. This allows the team to recognize hardships and triumphs so that they might learn from them going forward. This is an important part of the process to allow the team to get closer as they share in their failures and successes.

## Part Three: The Roles

There are three roles within the Scrum framework:
1. Product Owner
2. Scrum Master
3. Development Team

The Product Owner is the person who commissioned/had the vision for the product that the team is building. They are responsible for maximizing the value of the product for the company while taking into account customers and market requirements for the product to be successful. They help prioritize the work to be done by the development team and make sure the team understand their vision for the product.

The Scrum Master is the facilitator of the process. They are the one in charge of running the daily stand ups, the sprint planning meetings, the retrospective, and more. They coach the team and product owners while removing obstacles in the Scrum framework to optimize the work being completed.

The development team are the engineers coding the product. They are the sculptors that make the Product Owner's vision come alive. They spend most of their time coding and testing the product based on the current sprint backlog.

## Part Four: Why You Should Care

Scrum is becoming an industry standard for IT. Even if you will not be facilitating Scrum meetings or running a team, you will use Scrum in your career. It is important to be familiar with the system you are working in and to be comfortable with its concepts. This will give you an edge in the workforce if you are already familiar with the current industry standards.

Scrum is the most popular Agile methodology used in the industry today, but there are others as well. Even if your particular organization doesn't implement Scrum, odds are it will use an Agile framework of some sort. This means that learning the purpose of Agile and its systems is more important than ever to an aspiring software engineer.
